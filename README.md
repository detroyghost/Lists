# HTML Lists Practice

This repository contains an HTML page that demonstrates the use of different types of lists in HTML, including:

- **Unordered lists (`<ul>`)**
- **Ordered lists (`<ol>`)**
- **Nested lists (lists within lists)**

These are foundational HTML concepts used to organize content in a structured and readable way.
